<h1>Project for The Odin Project</h1>

<p>This is my project to re-create the front-end design of the Google homepage using HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>I completed this project as part of the Odin Project's <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css">curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>This was my first HTML/CSS project of this size. It took me about 6-7 hours to complete, from start to finish.</p>

<p>Almost all of this project was completed simply by looking at the Google design and trying to replicate it with HTML/CSS. 
I did look at Google's source-code and styles specifically to get accurate colors and to try to figure out the search-icon,
 but otherwise, everything was completed without reference to Google's source code.</p> 

<p>There were a couple areas that I struggled with, such as including icons in the search-bar. I now know how to fix these issues (as I've checked other solutions to the project),
 but I've chosen to upload this project in the state that I was able to do on my own, with those problems intact.</p>

<p>I also began this project before knowing Git best practice, so ignore all git commit messages. :) </p>
